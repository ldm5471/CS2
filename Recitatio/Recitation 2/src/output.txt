A test program for the 3 kinds of animals, e.g. camels, penguins and ducks.
The animals that possess a particular behavior, e.g. running,
speaking (Animal), diving (Swimmer), flying (Flyer) are exercised.
In the end the unique behavior of each animal is exercised individually.
This is the solution code.
